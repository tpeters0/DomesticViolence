Tried to find an API with dv statistics, but did not have luck

    - In theory, the bureau of justice statistics site's API should work with parameters of assault and perpetrator's relationship to the victim, but the problem, other than the site not being updated since 2013, is that it creates a file that downloads instead of an online response

      http://www.bjs.gov/developer/ncvs/developers.cfm

    - If I wanted to limit stats to Chicago, I might be able to pull from here:  http://api1.chicagopolice.org/clearpath/

    - This looks like a decent API to dig deeper into  -- if it actually had stats for countries such as the U.S.:
       http://api.dhsprogram.com/#/api-countries.cfm

    - Might be good for regular crime, but doesn't seem to specify domestic incidents: http://www.yourmapper.com/use-our-api.php

    - Some stats come from the CDC, http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf but not their API
