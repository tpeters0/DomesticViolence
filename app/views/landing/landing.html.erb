  <h2> Why should you learn about it? </h2>
  <p> Contrary to popular belief, domestic violence occurs across all socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. </p>

        <p> It has no boundaries and exists among dating relationships, same-sex relationships, and older victims.</p>
        <p> It also impacts the lives of children, people with disabilities, and immigrants.</p>
